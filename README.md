#Assignment 2

For this assignment, I used the penguins dataset. 
The data analysis script is called Test1
Test1 is an R file that uses packages descr and ggplot to examine the frequency of penguin species and the visual relationship between bill_length and bill_depth. 

To reproduce this make a frequency table of the variable species. And make a plot where x is bill_length_mm and y is bill_depth_mm, stacking a geom_line over a geom_smooth.

I added anovas to test the relationship between bill length and species and bill depth and spieces. 

create a model using the aov function where bill length/depth is the response and species is the explanatory and run a summary of your model.

##To collaborate with Bre
I created a separate branch where I completed my work

Added my code to her R script to provide summary statistics by species

Edited this README

Uploaded everything to be approved by Bre in Github
