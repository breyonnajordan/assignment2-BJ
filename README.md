#Assignment 2

For this assignment, I used the penguins dataset. 
The data analysis script is called Test1
Test1 is an R file that uses packages descr and ggplot to examine the frequency of penguin species and the visual relationship between bill_length and bill_depth. 

To reproduce this make a frequency table of the variable species. And make a plot where x is bill_length_mm and y is bill_depth_mm, stacking a geom_line over a geom_smooth.
